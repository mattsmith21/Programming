While working on this project, I created a program that allowed users to add tickets to a database, assign tickets to technicians, delete the tickets, and search by ticket names. 
I learned alot about databases and how to interact with forms on this project. 

What's included:
SQL Database.
Buttons to add, remove, and modify database entrys. 
Three forms.
  1 for viewing all tickets.
  1 for modifying individual tickets. 
  1 for adding tickets.
